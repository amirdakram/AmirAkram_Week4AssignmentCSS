            <p> I have lived in Harlem since the age of 12-13, 
                but I am originally from Atlantic City, New Jersey. 
                I have been pursuing a career in design ever since I moved here,
                transitioning from fashion design to illustration to graphic design.
                Starting off in the Cooper Hewitt's Design Scholars Program, I have done many internships
                and garnered first hand experience in what it looks like working in design and entertainment fields.

                with roasted potatoes for the rest of my life happily
